# **Next Steps**

## **UX Expert Prompt**
*"Based on this comprehensive PRD for the Enhanced AI-Powered Trading Engine, create a detailed front-end specification that addresses both the professional trading interface and educational learning system. Focus on the seamless integration between paper trading and live trading modes, the multi-chart analysis suite with NPU-accelerated pattern recognition, the F&O strategy center with real-time Greeks visualization, and the educational learning center with interactive tutorials. Pay special attention to the <50ms response time requirements, one-click trading execution across multiple APIs, and the advanced debugging console for system monitoring. Include detailed wireframes for all 8 core screens and specify the technical implementation using Streamlit with optimized Plotly components."*

## **Architect Prompt**
*"Using this comprehensive PRD, design a detailed full-stack architecture for the Enhanced AI-Powered Trading Engine that maximizes the Yoga Pro 7's hardware capabilities (13 TOPS NPU + 77 TOPS GPU + 32GB RAM) while maintaining strict budget constraints. Focus on the multi-API orchestration system with intelligent load balancing, NPU-accelerated AI models for pattern recognition and Greeks calculation, real-time data pipeline with sub-second updates, educational content delivery system, paper trading execution engine with identical code paths to live trading, and local deployment strategy. Include specific technical implementations for API rate limit management, security architecture with encrypted credential vault, comprehensive audit logging for SEBI compliance, and performance optimization strategies to achieve <30ms execution latency. Address the modular monolith architecture, testing strategy for both paper and live trading modes, and integration points between educational and trading systems."*
