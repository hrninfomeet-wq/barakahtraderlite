### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment Summary

**Overall Risk Score: 52/100 (High Risk Story)**

- **Critical Risks**: 1 (TECH-001: Mode switching integration complexity)
- **High Risks**: 6 (SEC-001, TECH-002, DATA-001, BUS-001, OPS-001, OPS-002)
- **Medium Risks**: 2 (PERF-001, DATA-002)

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. TECH-001: Mode Switching Integration Complexity (Score: 9 - Critical)
**Issue**: Complex integration with existing `execute_with_fallback` method could route paper trades to live APIs
**Impact**: Financial loss from accidental live trades
**Required Action**: Implement strict mode validation and separate execution paths

#### 2. SEC-001: Mode Confusion Security Risk (Score: 6 - High)
**Issue**: Users may accidentally place live trades when intending paper trades
**Impact**: Financial loss and user trust issues
**Required Action**: Implement prominent visual indicators and failsafe mechanisms

#### 3. TECH-002: Simulation Accuracy Challenge (Score: 6 - High)
**Issue**: 95% simulation accuracy requirement is challenging to achieve

1. **Mode Validation Architecture**
   - Modify `MultiAPIManager.execute_with_fallback` to include mode checking
   - Implement separate execution paths for paper vs live trading
   - Add failsafe mechanisms to prevent live API calls in paper mode

2. **Data Isolation Design**

**Risk Profile**: `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20250115.md`

### Recommended Status

**âœ— Changes Required** - Critical and high risks must be addressed before development can proceed safely.

**Next Steps**:
1. Address critical risk TECH-001 by designing mode validation architecture
2. Implement security safeguards for mode confusion prevention
3. Design data isolation strategy for paper/live data separation
4. Create comprehensive testing strategy for simulation accuracy
5. Re-assess risks after mitigation strategies are implemented

**Note**: This story requires significant architectural changes before development can begin. The high risk profile demands careful planning and mitigation to ensure system safety and user protection.
