# Story 1.1: Multi-API Authentication System

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** trader using multiple Indian brokers,  
**I want** secure, centralized management of FLATTRADE, FYERS, UPSTOX, and Alice Blue API credentials,  
**So that** I can trade across all platforms without manual credential management or security concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC1.1.1: System securely stores API keys for all four providers using AES-256 encrypted vault with local storage
- AC1.1.2: Authentication supports automatic token refresh for all APIs with 24-hour validity periods
- AC1.1.3: Health check validates connection status for each API every 30 seconds with status dashboard
- AC1.1.4: Real-time connection indicators (green/yellow/red) displayed for each API with response times
- AC1.1.5: Failed authentication triggers automatic retry with exponential backoff and user notifications
- AC1.1.6: Two-factor authentication integration with TOTP support for enhanced security
