# Story 2.3: Strategy Validation and Backtesting

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a strategic trader developing new approaches, I want comprehensive backtesting with transition to paper trading, so that I can validate strategies historically and test them in current market conditions before live deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC2.3.1: Historical backtesting engine using Backtrader with 5+ years of NSE/BSE/MCX data
- AC2.3.2: Strategy performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, and profit factor
- AC2.3.3: Monte Carlo simulation for strategy robustness testing under various market conditions
- AC2.3.4: Direct strategy deployment from backtesting to paper trading with identical code execution
- AC2.3.5: Walk-forward optimization capabilities for strategy parameter refinement

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Backtest runtime <5min for 5-year data (use chunking/NPU)
- Accuracy >95% validated via metrics
- Handle errors: invalid data, API failures, simulation timeouts
- Scalability: Support 100+ strategies in parallel

## Dev Notes
**Previous Story Insights**: From 2.2 - Fixed Pydantic configs, resolved imports, added missing methods, integrated with trading models. [Source: docs/stories/2.2.fo-educational-learning-system.md#dev-agent-record]

**Data Models**: Use OptionsStrategy (name, type, legs, conditions, risk_parameters), StrategyLeg (instrument, position, strike, expiry, quantity), RiskRewardProfile (max_profit, max_loss, breakeven, probability, ratio). Add BacktestResult (metrics, simulations). [Source: docs/architecture/fo-educational-system-architecture.md#3-strategy-models]

**API Specifications**: POST /strategy/validate (validate config), POST /strategy/analyze (risk/reward), GET /strategy/recommendations (based on market). Add /backtest/run (input strategy/data, output results), /backtest/optimize (walk-forward). [Source: docs/architecture/fo-educational-system-architecture.md#4-strategy-validation-api]

**File Locations**: backend/services/strategy_validator.py (validation/backtesting logic), backend/models/strategy.py (models), backend/api/v1/strategy.py (endpoints), backend/tests/unit/test_strategy_validator.py. Follow backend structure. [Source: docs/architecture/2-detailed-component-architecture.md#2.1-backend-architecture]

**Testing Requirements**: 90% unit coverage for validator, integration with paper trading, E2E for backtest-to-paper flow. Use factories for test data. [Source: docs/architecture/paper-trading-testing-strategy.md#2-unit-testing-strategy]

**Technical Constraints**: Use FastAPI async, Pydantic v2, SQLite for historical data. No specific coding standards file found.

**Data Flow Diagram:**
```
Market Data → Backtest Engine → Metrics Calc → Optimization → Paper Deployment
    ↓             ↓               ↓             ↓
Validation    Simulation      Risk Check    Mode Validator
```

**Risk Mitigations**: Cross-validate data (integrity); use NPU for perf; strict mode checks (integration); thresholds for accuracy. [Source: QA Analysis]

## Tasks
- [x] Implement backtesting engine with Backtrader integration (AC2.3.1)
  - Subtask: Integrate historical data pipeline with validation
- [x] Add performance metrics calculation (AC2.3.2)
- [x] Implement Monte Carlo simulation with error handling (AC2.3.3)
- [x] Create direct deployment to paper trading with mode checks (AC2.3.4)
- [x] Add walk-forward optimization with scalability (AC2.3.5)
- [x] Implement error/resilience: invalid data handling, timeouts
- [x] Write unit/integration tests per testing strategy, including QA scenarios
