# **Executive Summary**

This System Architecture Document defines the complete technical blueprint for the Enhanced AI-Powered Personal Trading Engine, optimized for the Yoga Pro 7 14IAH10 hardware platform. The architecture leverages a **modular monolith design** with multi-API orchestration, NPU-accelerated AI processing, and local deployment to achieve sub-30ms execution latency while maintaining strict budget constraints under $150.

## **Architectural Principles**
- **Performance First**: Sub-30ms order execution, <50ms UI response times
- **Hardware Optimization**: Maximum utilization of 13 TOPS NPU + 77 TOPS GPU + 32GB RAM
- **Multi-API Resilience**: Zero single points of failure with intelligent failover
- **Local Deployment**: Complete system runs on localhost for security and speed
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with microservice-style modules
- **Educational Integration**: Seamless paper trading with identical code paths
