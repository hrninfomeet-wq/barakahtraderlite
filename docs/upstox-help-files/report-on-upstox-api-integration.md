Here is a **detailed, step-by-step technical report** on how to integrate the Upstox API into a trading system dashboard, designed for clarity and direct reference by AI coding tools or automation models (e.g., in Cursor). This covers authentication, data consumption, order placement, portfolio management, live market data, and instrument list handling based on the latest official documentation and SDKs.[1][2][3]

**Step-by-Step Upstox API Integration Guide for Trading Dashboards**

***

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- Register as a developer at Upstox to get your client ID and secret.
- Install Python (>=3.4 recommended) and required Python modules.
- Obtain sandbox and production API access via Upstox Developer Console.

### 2. **Official Python SDK Installation**
```bash
pip install upstox-python-sdk
```
or clone directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/upstox/upstox-python.git
```
This SDK abstracts REST endpoints and WebSockets for market/order data.[3]

### 3. **Authentication (OAuth2.0 Flow)**
- **User Authorization:** Redirect your user to the Upstox authorization URL.
- After successful login, you'll receive an authorization `code` (in the redirect URL).
- Exchange this code for an `access_token` (needed for all further API calls).

**Example:**
```python
from upstox_client.rest import ApiException
from upstox_client import Configuration, ApiClient, LoginApi

config = Configuration()
login_api = LoginApi(ApiClient(config))
# Use login_api to generate URL, fetch authorization code, then exchange code for access token
```
*Reference official [authentication docs].*[1]

### 4. **Instrument List: Loading and Filtering Scrips**
- Download and parse JSON (recommended) or CSV files to get all available scrips.
- Instrument details include `instrument_key`, `exchange`, `name`, `symbol`, `type`, etc.
  - [JSON format URLs]:[2]
    - Complete: `/complete.json.gz`
    - NSE: `/NSE.json.gz`
    - See field mapping in [docs].[2]

```python
import gzip, json
with gzip.open("complete.json.gz", "r") as f:
    instruments = json.load(f)  # List of dicts, filter as needed
```

### 5. **Market Data Consumption (Quotes and WebSocket Streaming)**
- **REST API**: For latest, snapshot data (quotes, OHLC, option chain, Greeks, etc.).
- **WebSocket API**: For real-time tick data and order updates.
  - Use `MarketDataStreamer` and `PortfolioDataStreamer` classes in the SDK.
  - Subscribe using instrument_keys for efficient data handling.

**Example:**
```python
from upstox_client import MarketDataStreamer

def on_message(msg):
    print(msg)
streamer = MarketDataStreamer(ApiClient(config))
streamer.on("message", on_message)
streamer.connect()
```
*See [WebSocket example].*[3]

### 6. **Orders: Place, Modify, Cancel, and Status**
- Use the `OrderApi` and associated request/response models.
- All orders require a valid `access_token` and proper request body (with instrument_key, quantity, price, order_type etc.).
- Orders can be placed in both sandbox (for testing) and live environments.

**Example:**
```python
from upstox_client import OrderApi, PlaceOrderV3Request
body = PlaceOrderV3Request(quantity=1, product="D", validity="DAY", price=100.0, 
                           tag="test", instrument_token="NSE_EQ|INE669E01016", 
                           order_type="LIMIT", transaction_type="BUY")
order_api = OrderApi(ApiClient(config))
order_api.place_order(body)
```
*See [README] for more.*[3]

### 7. **Portfolio and Fund Management**
- Retrieve positions, holdings, trade history, and fund details using the corresponding APIs.
- Example endpoints:
  - `/v2/portfolio/short-term-positions` for positions
  - `/v2/user/get-funds-and-margin` for available margin & funds

### 8. **Historical Data and Analytics**
- Use endpoints like `/v2/historical-candle/{instrumentKey}/{interval}/{to_date}/{from_date}`.
- Integrate this data for building analytic dashboards, backtests, or performance charts.

### 9. **GTT (Good Till Triggered) and Advanced Order Types**
- Supported through additional API endpoints.
- Useful for building dashboards supporting advanced trading logic.

### 10. **Security, Rate Limits, Error Handling**
- Always check API limits and handle error responses gracefully.
- Tokens expire, so implement a refresh-workflow for re-authentication.
- Use the sandbox for all development before switching to production.

### 11. **Community and Sample Implementations**
- Refer to:
  - Upstox [GitHub SDK repo] (real code, test cases, and examples)[3]
  - [Upstox Developer Community](https://community.upstox.com/c/developer-api/15) for FAQs and troubleshooting
