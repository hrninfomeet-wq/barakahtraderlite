### **Background Context**

The Indian trading landscape represents a massive ₹5-7 Lakh Crore daily opportunity with 15+ Crore registered investors. Retail participation has grown from 15% to 40% of total volume, with F&O representing 60%+ of trading activity. However, current trading platforms suffer from critical limitations:

**Market Gaps:**
1. **Single API Dependency**: Broker downtime creates trading interruptions
2. **Limited F&O Automation**: Basic strategies without Greeks optimization
3. **Lack of AI Integration**: No sophisticated ML models for Indian market patterns
4. **Missing Educational Tools**: No paper trading or guided learning systems
5. **Hardware Underutilization**: No leverage of modern NPU/AI acceleration
6. **Cost Barriers**: Expensive professional platforms with limited customization

**Indian Market Opportunity:**
- **Index Derivatives**: ₹2-3 Lakh Crore daily (NIFTY, Bank NIFTY, FINNIFTY, BANKEX)
- **Equity Trading**: ₹1-2 Lakh Crore daily with strong retail participation
- **F&O Trading**: ₹4+ Lakh Crore daily with premium collection and directional strategies
- **MCX Commodities**: ₹50,000+ Crore daily in Gold, Silver, Crude Oil, Natural Gas
- **BTST Opportunities**: ₹50+ Lakh Crore overnight equity movements with AI prediction potential

This PRD addresses these gaps by creating a locally-deployed, multi-API trading ecosystem optimized for Indian markets with comprehensive educational features and professional execution capabilities.
