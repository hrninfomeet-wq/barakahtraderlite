## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Mode Switching Integration Tests**: Verify paper trades never reach live APIs
- **Security Tests**: Verify mode isolation and failsafe mechanisms
- **Data Isolation Tests**: Verify paper/live data separation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Simulation Accuracy Tests**: Verify 95% accuracy target achievement
- **Performance Tests**: Verify <1 second mode switching
- **User Experience Tests**: Verify intuitive mode switching interface

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests

- **Historical Performance Tests**: Verify analytics consistency
- **Load Tests**: Verify system performance under stress
- **Regression Tests**: Verify existing functionality not affected

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (TECH-001)
- All high risks affecting security/data (SEC-001, DATA-001)
- High risks affecting core functionality (TECH-002, OPS-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Business risks with user education (BUS-001)
- Testing complexity with comprehensive test suite (OPS-002)

### Accepted Risks

- Performance risks with monitoring in place (PERF-001, DATA-002)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Mode switching latency, simulation accuracy
- **Security alerts**: Mode switching events, authentication failures
- **Error rates**: Integration failures, data isolation issues
- **Business KPIs**: User adoption, mode switching frequency

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Architecture changes significantly (especially MultiAPIManager)
- New trading APIs added
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
