### Critical Gaps

1. **AC2.2.6 Integration Testing**
   - Gap: No integration tests for contextual help with trading UI
   - Risk: Medium - Could miss user experience issues
   - Recommendation: Add integration tests for help system

### Quality Metrics

**Test Results:**
- Unit Tests: 16/16 passing (Greeks calculator)

- Overall Test Health: GOOD with minor integration gap

**Code Quality:**
- Implementation: COMPLETE for all ACs
- Error Handling: ADEQUATE
- Documentation: GOOD
- Architecture: ALIGNED with existing systems

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: AC2.2.6 integration gap (contextual help UI)
- **Low Risk**: Minor warning in Greeks calculator (handled gracefully)

### Recommendations

**Immediate:**
1. Add integration tests for contextual help system
2. Create QA gate for Story 2.2

**Future:**
1. Enhanced P&L visualization components
2. Advanced certification tracking

**Status:** READY FOR GATE CREATION
