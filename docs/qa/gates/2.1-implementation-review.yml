final_verdict: |
  Story 2.1 implementation is COMPLETE and meets all acceptance criteria.
  The paper trading engine is well-architected with proper mode validation,
  data isolation, and realistic simulation. Minor dependency issues need
  resolution before production deployment. Recommend proceeding to PO
  acceptance after dependency fixes.
