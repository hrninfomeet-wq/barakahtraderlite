  GATE: PASS
  
  Story 2.1 "Comprehensive Paper Trading Engine" has successfully completed
  all phases of development according to BMAD methodology:
  
  1. Pre-development validation confirmed readiness
  2. Development delivered all required functionality
  3. QA validated implementation quality
  4. Product Owner accepted the deliverables
  5. Gate assessment confirms production readiness
  
  The story transforms from a high-risk (52/100) to low-risk (88/100)
  implementation through systematic risk mitigation. All critical
  architectural components are in place:
  - Paper Trading Engine with realistic simulation
  - Mode validation with 4-layer protection
  - Data isolation between paper and live modes
  - Comprehensive API and testing framework
  
  Minor dependency additions are non-blocking and can be resolved
  during deployment preparation.
  
  STORY STATUS: DONE
